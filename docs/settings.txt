==================
Available Settings
==================

Here is a list of all available settings of django-campaign and their
default values. All settings are prefixed with ``CAMPAIGN_``, although this
is a bit verbose it helps to make it easy to identify these settings.


CAMPAIGN_BACKEND
----------------

Default: ``'campaign.backends.send_mail'``

The backend used for the actual sending of the emails. The default backend
``campaign.backends.send_mail`` uses Django's built-in e-mail sending
capabilities.

Additionally the following backends are available:

  * ``campaign.backends.django_mailer``: Uses the resuseable django_mailer 
    app to queue mails in the database and bulk-send them via cron-job. 

  * ``campaign.backends.debug``: Simple backend which prints some information
    on stdout instead of sending the email. This only exists to demonstrate
    how to extract different values from the supplied email message instance.

Please see the :ref:`backend docs <ref-backends>` about implementing your 
own backend.


CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
---------------------------

Default: ``()`` (empty tuple)

Similar to Django's Template Context Processors these are callables which take
a Subscriber object as their argument and return a dictionary with items to 
add to the Template Context which is used to render the Mail.
